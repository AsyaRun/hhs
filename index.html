<h2>01 — Foundation</h2>
<p>Value Architecture</p>

<h3>Core question:</h3>
<p>What client problem are we solving?</p>

<p>At this level we define:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who the real customer is</li>
<li>What pain we address</li>
<li>How the product is actually used</li>
<li>What value is created and how it is measured</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key insight:</h3>
<p>If value is unclear, scaling increases noise instead of impact.</p>
